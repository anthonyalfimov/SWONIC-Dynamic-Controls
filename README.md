# Development branch

## Installation scripts

OSX installation script checks whether `~/Documents/ROLI/LittleFoot/` folder exists and creates it if necessary, and then copies over all `.littlefoot` files and `.littlefootMode` folders from the folder that contains the installation script.
If files already exist at the destination, they are overwritten.

## Notes

- Renamed "Dynamic Controls XYZ" into simply "Dynamic Controls"
- Deleted "Readme.pdf" and Modes as they will have to be redone for the new release
